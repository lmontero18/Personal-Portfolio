        <p>
          Katalogue is a platform I co-founded to empower creators and
          entrepreneurs in Costa Rica and LATAM to build beautifully structured,
          public-facing product collections. It's designed to be lightweight,
          fast, and visually engagingâ€”perfect for showcasing favorite tools,
          curated items, or inspiration boards.
        </p>
        <p>
          I led the technical side: frontend architecture, backend API design,
          and database modeling. The stack includes Next.js, TailwindCSS,
          Prisma, and Framer Motion to deliver a polished and performant
          experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Katalogue is currently available in Spanish only, as we're focused on
          supporting Spanish-speaking creators across Latin America.
