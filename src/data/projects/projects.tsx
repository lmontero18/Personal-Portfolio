          Katalogue is a platform I co-founded to empower creators and
          entrepreneurs in Costa Rica and LATAM to build beautifully structured,
          public-facing product collections. It&apos;s designed to be
          lightweight, fast, and visually engagingâ€”perfect for showcasing
          favorite tools, curated items, or inspiration boards.
        </p>
        <p>
          I led the technical side: frontend architecture, backend API design,
          and database modeling. The stack includes Next.js, TailwindCSS,
          Prisma, and Framer Motion to deliver a polished and performant
          experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Katalogue is currently available in Spanish only, as we&apos;re
          focused on supporting Spanish-speaking creators across Latin America.

        <p>
          <strong>JobFit AI</strong> is a tool I built to help users evaluate
          how well their resume matches a specific job description. The app uses
          OpenAI to analyze compatibility, highlight strengths and weaknesses,
          and generate actionable recommendations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Users can upload a PDF of their resume and paste in a job description.
          The platform parses the content, runs the analysis, and presents
          results such as: compatibility score, key improvements, and technical
          focus areas.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the tech side, I used <strong>Next.js 15</strong>,{" "}
          <strong>TypeScript</strong>,<strong>TailwindCSS</strong>, the{" "}
          <strong>OpenAI API</strong>, and <strong>pdfjs-dist</strong> for PDF
          parsing. I also solved several production challenges such as handling
          `canvas` errors in serverless environments like Vercel.
        </p>
        <p>
          JobFit AI was designed to be lightweight, intuitive, and helpful for
          junior and mid-level devs preparing for job applications.
